# Readable Project

This is my solution for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where I build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server, provided by udacity as well as the frontend web app that I wrote.

## Start Application

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* Install and start the frontend
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).

## Frontend

Information about the frontend and how to use it can be found in its [README file](frontend/README.md).
